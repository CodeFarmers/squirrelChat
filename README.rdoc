Just a simple chatbox with saved history for easy collaboration.

===Goal:
A simple chatbox that saves and can display the entire chat history.
When you come online it will show you an overview of messages that were sent while you were offline and/or the last X messages.
This makes it easy to collaborate on a project since you can chat in realtime or send notes, updates or reminders when the other people are offline.
