===Goal:
A simple chatbox that saves and can display the entire chat history.
When you come online it will show you an overview of messages that were sent while you were offline.
You can also easily view the entire chat history.
This makes it easy to collaborate on a project since you can chat in realtime or send notes, updates or reminders when the other people are offline.
